# AlpcDemo
The AlpcDoMyRPCClient project (compiled by x64) simulates the RPC request and sends the HelloProc() request to MyRPCServer through Alpc.

The AlpcDoRunAdminProcess project (compiled by x64) simulates the RPC request and pops up the UAC window to create an administrator process through Alpc. It should be noted here that the Alpc port number defined in "#define EXECUAC_ALPC_NAME L"\RPC Control\LRPC-50ddf8142f3561885f" in the project must be obtained through RpcView or dynamically obtained through the RPC service Endpoint Mapper. It`s randomly generated by the system.
